The request intake is where you choose the Vendor or Tool for which you want to create a purchase request. You'll also assign an owner to the request, this person will be responsible for managing the request through the approval process. Read more about owners here.

Add members of the sales team from the company you are looking to make a purchase from to assist with completing the request. Their input will be visible to you, and you can make changes before moving the request forward. You can invite others to join the process at any stage.

### Request Steps

After completing the intake process, you'll proceed through additional steps to gather and organize the data required for the request. The step categories are listed below. You can add or remove steps as needed and assign an internal approver once each step is complete.
