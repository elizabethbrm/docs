We're excited to have you on board\! Follow these quick steps to start getting value from BRM right away.

### 1. Bring your contracts into BRM

- Connect your email so BRM can automagically collect vendor contracts.
- Make sure teammates who sign contracts connect their emails too.
- Using a Google Group like [contracts@yourcompany.com](mailto:contracts@yourcompany.com)? If any group member connects their work email to BRM, BRM will collect all contracts sent to the group.
- Prefer to upload files? You can import agreements directly.

### 2. Review an verify your agreements

- We make it easy to confirm what's in your system
- Too many contracts to go through yourself? Email us at [support@brm.ai](mailto:support@brm.ai), and we'll verifiy them of you.

### 3. Set up notifications for you and your team so you never miss a renewal

- Connect Slack and fine-tune your email notifications
- Sync your BRM Renewal Calendar with your work calendar to stay on top of renewal deadlines.
- Assign business owners to your vendors and invite them to BRM so they get notified about upcoming reneals for the softwares they own.
