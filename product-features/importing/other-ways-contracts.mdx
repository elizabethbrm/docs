Connect your inbox to BRM to automatically import signed agreements.  BRM's contract collector scans your authenticated Gmail for fully executed vendor agreements. It securely stores relevant documents and provides a review process to keep your organization organized and up-to-date, all while maintaining strict privacy controls.
