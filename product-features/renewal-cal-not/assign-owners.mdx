# What is an owner?

Every software and vendor in BRM is assigned a single owner. This person is the primary point of contact for any inquiries about the status of that software or vendor.

Owners are designated during the onboarding process and their assignments can be updated in BRM over time.

# Prerequisites and steps for assigning owners 

For an owner to be assigned, there are two prerequisites:

- The "person" has to exist in BRM

  This can be done by:
  - [Inviting them ](https://support.brm.ai/articles/2035547931-how-to-add-a-user-in-brm)- `BRM Lite`
  - Integrating your HRIS (people are created automatically) – `BRM Enterprise`
- The vendor has to exist in BRM

  This can be fulfilled by:
  - Verifying the vendor's agreement – `BRM Lite `
  - Vendor created through a transaction via integration – `BRM Enterprise `

_Once these conditions are met, you can assign owners in BRM._
