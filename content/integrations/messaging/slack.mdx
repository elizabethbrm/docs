BRM’s Slack integration allows BRM to send notifications to **users that opt-in** and to access BRM’s co-pilot assistant. BRM’s Slack bot will never message a user that is not a user in BRM or does not have Slack notifications enabled.

Users, with the right permissions, can also message the BRM Slack bot to instantly and intelligently retrieve information about their vendors, software, and agreements on the go without having to enter the app.
