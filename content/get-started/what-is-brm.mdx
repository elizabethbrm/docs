BRM is an AI powered collaboration tool that empowers companies to find, evaluate, purchase, and manage software and vendors. This is made possible by automagically connecting your vendor-related systems (spend management, IAM/SSO, legal, compliance, info sec) together into a single, unified system of record.

Our mission is to help people produce their best work product through arming them with the right tools.

## Why does BRM exist?

### Buying problems aren’t cheap

Companies are perpetually buying, renewing, and paying for vendors. Whether it's finding new software, knowing what you already use, or reading through a contract––buying is messy, and hard. Ultimately, this means companies waste time and money, and aren’t equipping their teams with the right tools.

### Selling is streamlined while buying is chaotic

Over the years, software has been developed for every aspect of the selling process, starting with the CRM. Meanwhile, collaborating while buying happens across siloed point solutions, and horizontal productivity softwares.

### The easy questions aren’t so easy

With companies focused on growth and their own customers, it's typical to lose track of what softwares you use, and how quickly spend can creep up. It’s about time buyers had a horizontal software platform that could answer basic questions with ease.
