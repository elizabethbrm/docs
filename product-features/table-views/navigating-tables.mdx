## CRM, For the Buyers

Your BRM is organized into two primary tables: **Software** and **Vendors**. These tables are driven by the criteria that each stakeholder has configured. Data from all your systems, including activity usage, spend, and compliance review, is centralized for streamlined management.

### Renewal Calendar

Never miss a renewal again with BRM. Achieve full coverage on your spend based on the agreement data you've entered into BRM. This replaces the manual human process traditionally required for renewal management that is costly in time and errors.

### Views

Different stakeholders have varying needs. To accommodate this, BRM allows you to create and save custom views. Views are essentially saved presets of your BRM filters. You can create personal filters for individual use or organization-wide filters that can be leveraged by others. Quickly access the information most relevant to your needs.

### Statuses

Statuses in BRM help you stay on top of the state that a current software or vendor is in. You can update the status of a software or vendor (_e.g._, marking a software as canceling) to reflect its current state.

BRM makes is easy for all departments to track and manage their vendors. Today there is support for IT, Finance, and Compliance. This enables each department to know just not what the status of the vendor is within their team, but also the broader company.

Statuses can be changed in the vendor and software tables and on the detail pages themselves.

BRM will also use statuses to provides you intelligent insight. For example, if BRM detects an upcoming renewal (when you donâ€™t have an agreement on file), it will automatically mark the software with a "Warning" status, prompting you to add an agreement and prepare for a request.
