### Status Responsibility

An owner's main duty is to maintain the softwares and vendors they oversee in good order. This encompasses ensuring user licenses are correctly provisioned, maintaining software compliance, keeping documentation current, and addressing renewals proactively. These responsibilities are reflected in the software's status.

In the example below, the owner, Connor, sees that one of his softwares has dropped to `Warning`. He investigates and finds a comment from Compliance indicating that the SOC2 is outdated, and he promptly uploads the latest version.
