title: "Verifying Your Agreement Data"

Ensure the accuracy of your contract data by verifying key terms extracted by BRM. Verification is a quick, essential step that helps maintain data integrity across your organization.

## What is Agreement Verification?

After your contracts are collected, either through the **Contract Collector** (which syncs agreements from Gmail) or via **bulk upload**, BRM’s AI extracts important metadata from each agreement. This includes the following and more:

- Total Contract Value
- Contract Start and End Dates
- Payment Terms

These details power reporting, tracking, and workflows within BRM. To make sure everything works correctly, it’s important to verify that the extracted information is accurate.

## Why Verification Matters

Even with high-quality AI extraction, contracts can vary in formatting and structure. Verification ensures that:

- Your contract data reflects what’s actually in the agreement.
- Financials, timelines, and obligations are reported correctly.
- Any downstream processes based on this data run smoothly.

Verifying only takes a few moments and helps prevent issues later.
