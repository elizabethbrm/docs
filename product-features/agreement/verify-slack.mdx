## Verify within Slack 

1. Receive and review the Slack message\
   When Contractor Collector finds a document that changes an agreement, Slack will send you a message that includes:
   - Agreement name
   - Link to the new document
   - "Verify" , "Edit", or "View in BRM" button
2. Verify (or edit) directly from BRM

   Review the agreement, edit if needed, and then select "VERIFY."

3. If you need to correct or change fields within your agreement later, open the agreement in BRM from Agreements → All Agreements → [Your Agreement] → edit data within each field.
