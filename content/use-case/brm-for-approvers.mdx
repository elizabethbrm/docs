## Criteria and Request Configuration

As an approver, ensure your review process is integrated into BRM by setting up your Criteria and configuring each Request Type accordingly.

### Configure Criteria

Criteria represent the information stored in BRM’s records. Changes to criteria affect all platform aspects—softwares, tables, requests, etc. Establishing solid criteria initially is crucial.

1. Navigate to Settings → Criteria.
2. Toggle the desired fields in your BRM.
3. Use the "\+" button to add criteria (with name, description, and datatype).

### Configure Requests

Requests align with your Criteria, letting you tailor processes uniquely. For instance, an organization’s renewal process might be more streamlined than a new purchase.

1. Go to Settings → Requests.
2. Choose and configure the request type.
3. Edit request steps as needed.
4. Adjust specific fields within steps based on your Criteria.
5. Include or exclude fields, and set whether "N/A" is an acceptable response.

## Request Approvals

After setting Criteria and Requests, the next steps involve approvals. Each Request Step corresponds to a function with a designated approver. Upon submission, the approver reviews the step.

### Field Approval

Approvers can validate individual fields, allowing reviews to start as information is collected.

### Step Approval

Direct step approval is possible without field-by-field approval. Once approved, steps can be unapproved, but subsequent steps will not be reversed.
