## What can BRM do?

### Let your systems talk to each other

Software and vendor management involves multiple functions and their respective systems: Finance operates out of NetSuite, IT out of Okta, Legal out of Ironclad, etc. BRM integrates these systems, enabling you to make intelligent decisions with all necessary data at your fingertips.

### Set your criteria and leverage the BRM Listings network

Different departments can define their own criteria, the set of requirements that softwares and vendors must meet. This simplifies the process for line-of-business owners and vendors during intake. BRMâ€™s global listings align with your standard criteria, making purchasing more straightforward than ever.

### Streamline renewals and new purchases

Key steps in the purchasing process are often overlooked. Risk assessments, for instance, are sometimes conducted only after a vendor is paid and onboarded. BRM Requests ensure that no aspect is neglected and all criteria are considered prior to integrating a software or vendor into the organization.
